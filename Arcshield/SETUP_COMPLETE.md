## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About the Backend (Solana Program)
- The **frontend will work** and you can see the UI
- Some features need the Solana program deployed to work fully
- To deploy the program, you'll need Rust installed (see `START_HERE.md` Option 2)
- For now, you can explore the UI and see how everything works!

### About Wallet Connection
- Make sure your wallet extension is installed
- Make sure it's set to **Devnet** (test network)
- You can get free test SOL from: https://faucet.solana.com/

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "npm start" doesn't work?
- Make sure you're in the `frontend` folder
- Try running `npm install` first

### Browser doesn't open?
- Manually go to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Wallet won't connect?
- Check wallet is installed
- Check wallet is on Devnet
- Refresh the page

### Port 3000 in use?
- Close other apps
- Or wait - the script will handle it
