# Introduction

Veil is a privacy aggregation layer for Solana.

It provides a single, unified interface for sending private transactions, abstracting away the complexity of underlying privacy protocols.

Developers use Veil to build privacy-preserving applications without locking themselves into a single provider or maintaining multiple disparate SDK integrations.

## The Problem

Privacy on Solana is fragmented. To support multiple privacy solutions, you typically have to:

-   Manage multiple dependencies with conflicting versions.
-   Learn unique SDK patterns for each protocol.
-   Handle different compliance and proof generation flows.
-   Rewire your UI whenever a protocol updates or deprecates a feature.

Veil solves this by treating privacy protocols as **interchangeable adapters**. Your application expresses an *intent* ("Send 100 USDC privately"), and Veil handles the *execution* via the most appropriate available adapter.

## What Veil Is Not

-   **Veil is not a new zero-knowledge proof system.** It leverages existing, battle-tested protocols.
-   **Veil is not a compliance tool.** While adapters may enforce compliance, Veil itself is a neutral routing layer.
-   **Veil is not a wallet.** It integrates with existing wallet adapters to sign transactions.

## When To Use Veil

**Use Veil if:**
-   You want to offer privacy features (like private payments or payroll) in your app.
-   You want to switch between privacy providers without rewriting application logic.
-   You prefer a stable, high-level API over low-level cryptographic plumbing.

**Do NOT use Veil if:**
-   You are building a custom ZK protocol from scratch and need raw access to the proving circuit.
-   You need features specific to one protocol that aren't generalized (e.g., protocol-specific staking mechanisms).
