# Private Payments

Most users do not want "anonymity" in the illicit sense. They want **confidentiality** in the commercial sense. They don't want their salary, rent payments, or business suppliers visible to the entire world on a block explorer.

## The Goal: Privacy, Not Secrecy

When building a payment flow, you often face a dilemma:
1.  **Raw Solana Transfers:** Fast, cheap, but completely public.
2.  **Mixers/Tornado Cash:** Private, but slow, expensive, and often flagged by compliance tools.

Veil targets the middle ground: **shielded transfers**.

## How Veil Handles It

When you execute a payment via Veil, you aren't just broadcasting a `SystemProgram.transfer`.

```typescript
await veil.send({
  recipient: 'VendorPublicKey...',
  amount: 500,
  token: 'USDC'
});
```

### The Selection Process

1.  **Analysis:** Veil sees a request for `USDC`.
2.  **Routing:** It checks if a privacy adapter (like Light Protocol or Elusiv) is available for this token.
3.  **Execution:**
    *   If a privacy adapter is active, it generates a Zero-Knowledge proof on the client side.
    *   It submits the proof to a relayer or the chain directly.
    *   The recipient receives the funds from a shared pool, breaking the on-chain link between sender and receiver.

## Compliance and Auditing

The critical distinction here is that while the link is broken for the *public observer*, the adapter often retains a **view key** or **proof of origin**.

This allows your application to generate a receipt or history for the user (and tax authorities) without exposing that data to the public internet.

## Why not just use the protocol SDKs directly?

Protocol SDKs are volatile. Privacy technology on Solana is evolving rapidly. If you hardcode your application to "Privacy Protocol V1", you are essentially technical debt waiting to happen.

By using Veil, you define the *intent* ("Pay this person privately"). If the underlying protocol upgrades its circuit or changes its proof generation API, your application code remains untouched. You simply update the Veil adapter dependency.
