# Adapters

Adapters are the interchangeable engines that power Veil.

## NoopPrivacyAdapter

The "No-Operation" adapter.

**What it does:**
It performs a standard, transparent SPL token transfer or SOL transfer. It offers **zero privacy**.

**Why it exists:**
-   **Local Development:** Test your UI flows without needing a prover or a live privacy network.
-   **Fallback:** Allows your app to gracefully degrade to standard transfers if privacy services are offline (optional configuration).

**When to use:**
-   Running tests on localhost.
-   Building UI components before the privacy contracts are live on your target network.

**When NOT to use:**
-   Production deployments requiring actual anonymity.
