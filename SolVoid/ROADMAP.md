#  SolVoid Roadmap

Our vision is to become the default privacy layer for the Solana ecosystem, providing institutional-grade anonymity with a consumer-grade user experience.

##  Phase 1: Foundation (Hackathon) - [CURRENT]
- [x] Initial Anchor Program implementation.
- [x] Circom circuits for basic SOL shielding.
- [x] TypeScript SDK for Merkle proof generation.
- [x] Basic Dashboard UI.
- [x] CLI for developers.

##  Phase 2: Fortification (Q1 2026)
- [ ] **MPC Trusted Setup:** Organize a community-driven ceremony for production proving keys.
- [ ] **SPL Token Support:** Extend shielding capabilities to USDC, BONK, and other SPL tokens.
- [ ] **Enhanced Privacy Ghost Diagnostics:** Add deep-learning based pattern analysis to the Ghost Scoring engine.
- [ ] **Optimized Verifier:** Implement a high-performance BN254 verifier using Solana's latest SIMD instructions.
- [ ] **Security Audit:** Complete a comprehensive 3rd-party audit of circuits and smart contracts.

---

##  Phase 3: Expansion (Q2 2026)
- [ ] **Mobile SDK:** Optimized proving for React Native and Flutter.
- [ ] **SolVoid Relayer Network:** A decentralized network of relayers with incentivized uptime.
- [ ] **Privacy Passports:** Zero-knowledge proof of personhood integration to prevent bot spam while maintaining anonymity.

---

##  Phase 4: Decentralization (2026+)
- [ ] **DAO Governance:** Hand over protocol parameters to the community.
- [ ] **Ecosystem Grants:** Support for developers building privacy-first dApps on SolVoid.
- [ ] **Inter-chain Privacy:** Bridges to other privacy-preserving ecosystems.
