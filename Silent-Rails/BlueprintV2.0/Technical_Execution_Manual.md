# 🏛️ $NORTH | Blueprint v2.0: Technical Execution Manual
## High-Velocity Privacy Infrastructure for Solana

---

### 01. FROM PHILOSOPHY TO INFRASTRUCTURE
We have moved from the "Grey Space" manifesto to a functional fortress. $NORTH provides the first professional cockpit where high-velocity execution meets absolute discretion.

---

### 02. PROTOCOL 01: THE SENTINEL
* **Handshake Logic**: Data fragmentation into encrypted micro-packets.
* **Ephemeral Key Management**: Dynamic session encryption registry with zero linkability.
* **400ms Privacy Overhead**: Managed finality to ensure no performance degradation.
* **LUT Obfuscation**: Address Lookup Table compression to hide complex transaction intent.

---

### 03. PROTOCOL 02: THE VAULT
* **Zero-Knowledge Circuitry**: Metadata shielding at the smart contract level.
* **State Compression**: Drastic reduction in "Rent" costs for institutional scaling.
* **The $NORTH RPC Gateway**: Private tunnel bypassing the public mempool to eliminate MEV front-running.

---

### 04. SCALABILITY & PERFORMANCE (Track 02 Focus)
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Decoupling the validation from the privacy seal.
* **Throughput**: Stable **50,000 TPS**.
* **Latency**: **66ms** propagation latency matching Solana Mainnet native speed.
* **Silent Rails**: High-throughput routing for institutional volumes.

---

### 05. ECONOMIC SCARCITY (The Rarity Engine)
* **Weekly Burn**: Manual activation every Sunday based on MC milestones.
* **Phase-Based Deflation**: Acceleration of burn rates as market cap expands.
* **Buyback Mechanics**: 100% of corporate routing fees used for token recycling.
