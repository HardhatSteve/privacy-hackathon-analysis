Trying to work with the maker, can't do it here, it's written as a solidity file, we call it the Quasant Protocol and the test will run through the various scenarios and be running this as a full test.
Giving it a second, it will try to do the conduit first and then it will try to do the restaking and work through that.
The idea is we get a bunch of die tokens from the conduit as you can see we gave ourselves some mock die.
It's deposited through the conduit right here and we are trying to do LST restaking.
So we are working with Aigel there and you can see that we are referencing Aigel there's smart contracts here.
This right there is an Aigel there smart contract and it is a restaking protocol and right now the protocol is frozen as you can see from here it is paused.
So when the protocol doesn't limit its TVL anymore we can make this deposits and we can also withdraw once the protocol is unposted.
The idea is we make more yield from restaking and we can use that yield to like swap back the die and pay back the conduit.
We have all the code available here and on the github which is right here.
