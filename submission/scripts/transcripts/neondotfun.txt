Hey, my name is Antonio and I'm going to show you how this app works. It's pretty simple. So basically how it works is that we have, we have a smart contract on Neon EVM. On Neon EVM, what we can do is start making some goals to the Solana network. So we all know that meme coins are the gate for new users and it's getting pretty huge. So what we do is like we connect to that smart contract and that smart contract will interact with pom.fund so you can buy any meme coin from pom.fund on your EVM wallet, right? So for example, here, this one, it's the address of one of those is this one here. So for example, if I want to buy this meme coin, I should go to the Solana network, reach some funds and all that stuff, right? But what if you could do it right from your EVM wallet? So that's what I'm going to do. So you just need to put the, the, the, what the address of the, the token on the Solana network. So you just put it there and you just choose how many, since I'm going to make like a super, super, super, super easy example, I'm going to send some salt here. It's going to all, all done through the smart contract on Neon EVM. So that's the, the amount of, of tokens they want to swap. So I'm going to do this. It takes a little bit because it's all on, on, on, on mainnet. And you can see here, like I need to pay the real gas is this is, this is not a test net. This is mainnet. But yeah, I don't have enough gas. I'm going to be demo this live on the booth today. But once I click here on confirm, there's going to do many different things on the smart contract, right? The, the transaction will be creating a token account on, on the, on the, on the wallet, go and interact with palm.fun so we can actually get the meme coins. And then it's going to send back to the wallet, those, those meme coins. So it's a long process. It's, it's live. So it's going to take a little bit, a little bit more time. And I will show you this because it's, it's a little bit slow and well, that's it. Thank you.
