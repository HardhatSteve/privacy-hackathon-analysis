Okay, here we have a dashboard for an AI agent that I've created using CDP's agent kit, and it loads up and creates a wallet on Base Sepoia. Sometimes the faucet's failing, but it is also funding the wallet. And when I click Get Started, the agent will start analyzing trending tokens that are currently just hardcoded, but these trending tokens are used in the AI agent to create a new meme coin. And right now it's generating a potential meme coin, and then prompting me, the user, to create this token. And if I do so, it will create it on wow.xyz. And yeah, so the agent has now just pushed this to wow.xyz. And in the future, I could create different agents to go buy and sell, and even promote this new meme coin based on the trends. And if I'm auto-trading, it should try and attempt to create any new token that comes in on its own. And thank you. That's all.
