Imagine a decentralized future where borrowing is seamless, trustless, and efficient. Introducing the on-chain credit market and innovative protocol, leveraging the Indeswap V4 hooks to redefine credit and collateral management. In traditional lending systems, approval takes days and requires trust and intermediaries. Existing DeFi solutions often lack efficient credit assessment and dynamic fee structures. Investors are left with rigid, non-inverted borrowing experiences. Our protocol solves this by utilizing Uniswap V4 hooks. The collateral integrates directly with Uniswap pools, dynamically adjusting collateral and borrowing fees during swaps. Borrowers get better rates, and lenders enjoy high yields. A user deposits collateral into the protocol, then the collateral hook interacts with Uniswap V4 pools, ensuring dynamic pricing and fees. Then borrowers can leverage their collateral efficiently, while lenders earn optimized returns. Why Uniswap V4? Uniswap V4 features are highlighted, hooks, modular pools, and efficiency gains. Uniswap V4 powerful hooks enable us to integrate logic directly into Uniswap events. This allows us to automate collateral management and enforce safe borrower limits, all on-chain and trust-less. The main functionalities are what I had shown. A user is supposed to deposit collateral, a successful borrower transaction on-chain using Zipoly testnet, real-time fee calculation using the hooks from Uniswap V4. Here's our protocol in action. The on-chain market is the future of decentralized borrowing, scalable, dynamic, and trustlessness. Thank you for watching and we hope we share our vision for a better DeFi ecosystem. www.uniswap.com
