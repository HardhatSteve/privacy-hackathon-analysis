Hi everyone, we're Chameleon, and we're passionate about simplifying generative NFTs. Chameleon adapts to your creative ideas. Generate your own unique NFTs using only text prompts. With Chameleon, creating and minting is as simple as no skills required. Before we get into our demo, let's highlight some key features and their reasons. We use Polygon's protocol to benefit from its low fees, transaction speed, and EVM compatibility. Every NFT mint and OpenSea royalty incurs fees that we redirect back to the community. How does this work? Well, we give back 50% of our Nounsified NFT fees to NounsDAO, and the other 50% from regular NFTs to Gitcoin grants, supporting crypto growth and innovation. Nounsified NFTs are NFTs generated on our platform, which utilize noun traits inspired by nouns as art, culture, and ethos of nouns fund ideas. Their aesthetic is woven into our design. We view NounsDAO as an ideal introduction to the crypto and NFT world. We use the Filecoin protocol for reliable and lasting storage of all our platform's NFTs. To enhance user experience on Chameleon, we provide an AI chatbot for NFT guidance, making the NFT world easily approachable, particularly for newcomers. We've integrated WorldCoin for user login to ensure a safe and secure environment, preventing spam and cyber attacks. This feature also helps us easily impose rate limits on users who might abuse accounts limits. At Chameleon, we're making generative NFTs easy. Now, on to the demo.
