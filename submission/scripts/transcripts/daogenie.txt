Hi, this is Dow Ginny. It enables you to create a doubt that has the ability to
control a wet browser on behalf of the entire Dow without trusting any human
player. This means that it can do things like donate to charities that are not
on chain already. Let's open up our current Dow called test
Dow and in here we're going to create a new proposal. We're going to propose
donating 0.001 ETH to the water project. This is a project that offers crypto
donations but only through a web-to-interface where a different wallet address is
generated for each donation.
Now that we've created a proposal we can vote yes on it. This is going to pass
immediately since we're currently the only down member. Of course this would be
a regular voting process if there are multiple members.
Now you're going to see the Dow controlling a web browser. It's using AI to
navigate to different pages and click through the payment process in order to
complete this donation. You can see the highlighted clicks where the AI decides
to click on the page. It's feeding screenshots to the LLM to achieve this.
You can see here that it's even able to handle complex interactions like
understanding that it needs to clear out an existing text box before entering
the new amount. At each step it looks at the screenshot both before and after
performing the action to make sure that it's on the right track.
Now we're on the final step and we just need to get the payment address so that
the Dow can send funds. Now you can see that the AI has reached the web page
that has the address that the Dow should donate to. This is all without
trusting any human or any human intervention. In the background the Dow is
sending funds to this address.
