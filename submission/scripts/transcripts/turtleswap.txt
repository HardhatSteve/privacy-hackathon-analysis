Hello ETH Global Sydney 2024. This is a demonstration of TurtleSwap. TurtleSwap is a decentralised exchange that prioritises fairness. Unlike traditional exchanges, it only accepts market orders, simplifying the trading process. It relies on chain-linked price oracles for market prices, ensuring trades are only ever executed at fair value. TurtleSwap operates on the principle that market makers act as middlemen who only participate when it benefits them. Typically, they are there to act in times of price-time mismatches. Unlike traditional exchanges where market makers play a dominant role, TurtleSwap's design mitigates their influence, promoting a more democratic trading environment involving genuine participants only. In essence, TurtleSwap offers a new approach to decentralised trading, emphasising fairness and simplicity. By leveraging chain-linked price oracles and minimising market maker influence, it aims to revolutionise DeFi trading. In this demonstration, I will use this account to place a maker order to sell some link. This account currently has 15 links, and I will then use this account to place a taker order to buy that link. This account currently has 5 links. I will use Remix to do this demonstration. Here I am selecting the account that will place the maker order to sell the link. I am now going to call the make function on the TurtleSwap contract. I am now selecting the account that will place the taker order to buy the link. We can see the account that placed the maker order to sell the link now has 14 links. It had 15 previously. And the account that placed the taker order to buy the link has 6 links now. It had 5 previously. This was a very simple demonstration, but I hope it encourages others to think about a model that promotes fairness above everything else. Because TurtleSwap is designed to benefit genuine participants only, there may be less liquidity and so you have to be more patient when waiting for a trade. But remember, slow and steady wins the race.
