So we present you Rockstop. So here is whole repository and we have all the different links related to it. So first we have like the front end links as a deployed graphs related to whole project. And mainly we are working around Uniswap before and PancakeSwap before. And then we have all the links related to the deployment of the contract, on the testnet. And lastly, we have the repository. So now we will go on the front end. So it's called the Rockstop Factory. And so you begin with the introduction to the hook, to the factory, which tells you what it does. And what you can basically expect to it if you edit to your, you know, if you launch pools with it. And we begin with the dashboard that's connected to the graph API. So if we click here, we see there are four locks here already. And you can also create pools from this. This is the demonstration. So here you can choose a token A and a token B, and you can see how much token do you have. And you can choose how to create, to initialize a pool with a certain fee on Uniswap before, in your, connected to your hook. So then we submit like the transaction and it will go through and create a new lock in the pool dashboard. And then we can also manage whole locks. So if we go to the manage lock, maybe we can see a whole lock if I have some related. Yep. So it looks like the transaction is minted here and we can probably see it in the dashboard, maybe. Okay. We can see that the owner is my address. Yeah. And we can see it right now. Okay. Okay.
