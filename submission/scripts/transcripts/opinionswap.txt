Hey fellow developers, so this is the submission for EatSydney. I built OpinionSwap which is a trading platform where you can trade your opinions. As humans will have to give opinions about everything so I not get rewarded for it. Right, so you can go to the website there are a few proposals on which you can trade already and then when you cast it it will show up on your forecaster and then the entire trading experience is from the frame itself. So let's try betting. So this is about the Indian Premier League first proposal that who will win and we have added a Sybil check through world ID that gives you if you actually verify that you are a human so you get more rewarded more so yeah if you click on here what will happen is it there it will lead to your verifying world ID thing and once you scan it with your phone app you'll need to give the proof and we generate the proof and as soon as it's done we actually verify that it's done so yeah that's how it showcases and yeah it worked so once it's all done it will actually show up here as traded so yeah now let's let's have let's bet so let's bet on CSK so why not and when you click bet the entire transaction happens in the wallet it's in the simulation and it shows up it's a three dollar transaction it's on testnet so well doesn't really matter so yeah and as soon as it's done it shows up on the blockchain here and it will show up that you have placed your bet successfully and if you click check more bets it will lead to your appraisal itself right so fun thing about it you can also bridge money from here and there in if your funds are on a different particular chain so you can give particular USDC to optimism if it's required and we support as of now base and optimism chains because that's the chain CCIP is live on and once the entire process happens again from the frame itself which is pretty cool that you can approve and you can bet you can actually bridge the entire thing in the chain itself so yeah and let's see here what happens is we are sending the bridging transaction so you can check this particular transaction on the CCIP Explorer so I'll just copy paste this transaction in here and it shows up waiting for finality 9 seconds ago from base to optimism so yeah that's how it works if you are having troubles bridging your money from the real world to the on-chain world we have unlimited in here where through which you can on ramp with a simple UX and yeah well that's about it so the proposal creation can be done on mental and base blockchains CCIP powers the seamless multi-chain experience and on-ramp powers the real world to on-chain experience we also use world ID in order to have a Sybil check so yeah if I click here add campaign we are particularly right now on mental so this proposal will go live on mental and yeah will opinion swap when at EatSydney that's something you decide thank you that's that's the submission for EatSydney thank you for listening
