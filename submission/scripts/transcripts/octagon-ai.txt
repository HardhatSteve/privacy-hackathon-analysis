Okay, here we go, let's start at the beginning. So first of all, we firmly believe that AI is going to have the ability to massively revolutionize the crypto user experience as well as help solve a lot of problems. And we want to give developers the ability to prove the accuracy of their models on a given problem without actually having to reveal the weights, and therefore retaining full custody of their model while also being to monetize their work. We think this is important because these problems need to be solvable by everybody, not just very large teams that have a lot of AI engineers as well as crypto security engineers that can pay for audits and so on. Now here, you'll be able to post the problem for this presentation, we just limited ourselves on Uniswap. The problem is, here we go, takes a while to load sometimes. Here we go. This will be a description of the problem, right? So we're focusing on finding the optimal range to provide liquidity on Uniswap. And here you would see the lever board, which would have all the models and their accuracy over time, right? So we can even deploy our model here. Hello, I'm not going to waste time with this. On Uniswap, and here you would deploy your model. Here's the model that we have, it's just a simple model that we trained to output something. And here we'll deploy the model. Now this actually signs it and deploys it in an encrypted format to Filecoin in case you want to store it and fetch it later. For the presentation, you actually send the model to us and we compile it for you. But in practice, you could do this yourself even on the front end. Takes a while sometimes, it's just going to be a second. Here we go. Awkward silence, dot, dot, dot, and here we go, model deployed. So here we see our model, and now you could deploy the model. But this takes a while and you could deploy the strategy, we've already done this. We could do this in practice, but it takes a little while, so we're skipping it. Where are we with the, here we go, sorry for the interruption. So this is just the scale output. So this would actually be the prices, the liquidity, the fees, everything that you need to know. This is just an example to demonstrate. On inference, this would run the inference and make a proof. Here we go. So this is the proof. This is the proof and the verifier is already deployed on chain as well as the strategy that would actually use this to then run a vault that would deploy funds into Uniswap at the optimal range, right? So update liquidity, and this should be signing a transaction. Here we go, a little break again. Again, this takes too much time, so we just, for the presentation, we would do it live, but this is an example of a transaction that happens. You can see that it actually opens a Uniswap position based on the proof that was verified. You can see the events, should be some proof verified events somewhere. Increase liquidity, new position opened, there we go. And this is it for the demo. Yeah, and as well as some analytics to show you some graph of how well some models perform. This is some accuracy.
