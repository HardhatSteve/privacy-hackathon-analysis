Hi, I'm Ken Hodler. I'm here to introduce our hackathon project for scaling Ethereum. It's called SHH. SHH is a one-time read messaging system that uses the secret network to securely store messages and deliver secrets like passwords, private keys, credit card information, API keys, etc. It isn't like other secret data stores, though. Once a message is retrieved, it's burned, and it can't be retrieved again. So let me give you a little demo of how it works. So I can go in here and I can type a secret message. Okay. And then I'll create a secret token. Now, this runs on the secret network Holodeck 2 network, which is the test network. And it's integrated with Kepler, so it automatically pops up and asks me to sign, approve the message. So I'll do that. And then it creates a link for me in order to reveal the secret. So now I would be able to take this link and drop it into Slack or chat or send it via text message or whatever to whoever I want to reveal that secret to. And then once they get that link, they click it and they come here and they have to click burn to reveal. Again, it has to be approved by Kepler, the transaction. So I'll do that. And then the revealed message is there. This was all built. So the source code repositories are here. It consists of two different repositories. The first is the UI part. And these are all linked to in the submission document. So this is the UI part. And then we forked the reference implementation for secret NFTs, the SNP 721 protocol reference implementation. The changes that we made to it are that we allow anyone to mint tokens. Tokens can be minted only for yourself. Anyone can burn a token to reveal the secret. And we removed all the functionality around transferring, sending, minter management, and metadata queries. And then spent a bit of time organizing unit tests so that it was just easier to work with. And so this was built by Endowal. Endowal brings payable on def functionality to blockchain assets. We built as a way to experiment with the secret network. We wanted to evaluate whether it will work as a decentralized data store for sensitive estate planning data. Using the sealed data mechanism of SNP 721, we believe that we can use our LifeEvent Oracle to unlock this sensitive estate planning data when the time is right. So, oh, I should also demonstrate that if I try to try to reveal this token again, this message again, the transaction, and it is no longer available because the token has been burned. So, thanks for your attention.
