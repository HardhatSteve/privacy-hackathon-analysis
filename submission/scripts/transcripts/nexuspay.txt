Hello everyone, this is my application NexusPay which is basically a consumer focused merchant application using Halo tags which are basically standalone Ethereum or basically Elliptic Curve signature generators using which you can easily sign any transaction through this card and there won't be any need of a wallet so I'll quickly load my wallet so I have another card with me so this is basically the merchant card and I'll load the merchant's wallet okay so as you can see merchant's wallet is loaded you can change merchant can easily change their chains and or they can easily click on receive and enter the amount they want to receive okay and now this is basically the user's debit card wallet or crypto debit card wallet suppose they are in 7-11 and this merchant needs to receive a crypto payment so users can just pull out their Halo cards and then merchant will enter the amount they want to receive and just click on accept the payment and now the user just have to tap into the machine so as you can see I have received the 0.01 ETH so now from 0.3 it from 0.2 it has been increased to 0.3 and this is Nixus Pay
