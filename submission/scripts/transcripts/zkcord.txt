Hello everyone, I'm Ankit. I'm a software developer. I'm working in the cyclotron private product desktop. So while it will create the features on the creating collection of the NFTs and minting the NFT and we can verify the ownership. So while verifying the ownership or user can join the private event and private channels. So if he has an NFT holder, otherwise they can not. So let's go to the demo part. So in this, suppose, so there is the channel and now we will just trigger the event. So now I'm just creating the, verifying the command. So it will verify the ownership. Like suppose if I have created or connected the wallet, then and if I am an NFT holder, then we can join the private channel. This, um, now, uh, I'm just, now we have connected from the wallet. So we will verify the, okay. So your NFT has been verified successfully. And then we can also check the, on this account, like on the private call, I mean, uh, this NFT holder, it is there or not. So, so yeah, on this account, the NFT holder is there. So, uh, and if I want, this is the admin section and if I want to mint the NFT, so we can mint on the NFT also. So we are now, we will just, we will mint NFT on this account. So yeah, because on this, we have connected on the different account and we are using the, uh, different account. So you can see on that's the last one. So now we will just, uh, use the, whatever we had connected on this, that same account. So it will sign the transaction and, uh, the, yeah, the transaction is being successful. And we, where we can also check on the, um, uh, the sequence that is running on this, that transaction is happening on that. And, uh, well, this is the server where we can see the, uh, that is called what it is running on that. So, yeah, that's it. Thank you.
