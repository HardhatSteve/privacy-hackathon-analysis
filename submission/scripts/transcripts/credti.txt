Hey, I'm Elias, Elias Hedren and I'm presenting CREDIT. What CREDIT is, is a web-free and collateralized lending protocol based on Web 2.0 credit history. The goal of this is to allow people to transfer their Web 2.0 credit history and be able to get Web 3.0 credits. So the use cases are microloans to unbanked people. There are a lot of companies that are lending money to the unbanked people through their credit history and how much they use mobile applications, reputation-based lending, peer-to-peer lending, healthcare financing and a lot more things. So basically how the technology works is that it uses ZKTLS to share only the credit information that the user wants to share and the credit information can be used to assess the credit worthiness. So this is how it works. I'll just refresh the page. We are connected here and then we are mainly going for mobile, so it's cello, base, scroll and mentor. So the user generates a ZK proof and it will direct them. So they verify this ZK proof by logging in with their phone. So I will do this. So it is going to redirect me to the reclaim. So I'm using reclaim protocol. It's going to redirect me to reclaim protocol. I'm going to continue. Then I'll open it within the application. So I'll have to sign in here. I'll use my own information. So I'll use my bank details and then it will only share the bank details that are required. So it will generate a proof and only share the bank details. So the data is shared successfully and this is the only data that was shared. Not my name, not my other information. And this will be used to assess my credit worthiness. So I have here the proof that has been verified. I can see here the information such as my bank balance is here. So after the proof has been verified, the user can then go ahead and then borrow and get collateral and the money is sent to their bank account. So this is how it works and this is what we have implemented. There are smart contracts that have been deployed but you can check out as well. Thank you very much.
