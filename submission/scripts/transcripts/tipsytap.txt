Hello, we are the team of TipsyTap. Today, I will guide you through what TipsyTap is and how we are addressing the challenge of increasing blockchain adoptions while we are choosing memes and alcohol as part of our solution, the size of our market, and the demonstration of our product. TipsyTap is a tipping protocol designed for bars, nightclubs, event venues, and event organizers. Our protocol will be freely available for other meme coins on the base chains to use as tips. What do you tip with a meme coin named Be Drunk on base chain? Every crypto product ecosystem and infrastructures face a common challenge, onboarding users. We have a limited number of crypto users and a lack of scenarios that resonate with Web2 users. In the Tipping Points, a well-known marketing book, it is stated that viral marketing involves adding a little innovation to something people are already familiar with rather than introducing something entirely new. As an application, our goal is to integrate innovative technologies into something people are already familiar with, the meme and alcohol. So why memes? The natures of memes align naturally with the drinking culture. We use memes to create a crypto drinking club and the tipping function to establish a scenario that resonates with people's daily life. Furthermore, these tips will be served as an on-chain reputation on these businesses. In the future, it can be used as a crypto version of Yelp. It is as simple as a tipping jar sitting on the counter, indicating how popular the place is. So why the alcohol industry? Onboarding pure Web2 customers is challenging. The best customer segments are crypto users and learners, just like us. We come together because of events like ETH Global, Token2049, DevCon, etc. Happy hours, after parties, and set events are mandatory. I'm so excited to demonstrate the mobile version of TipsyTap. Designed to align with users' behavior, our demo will showcase two user cases, the individual case and the business case. Let's start with the individual case. Imagine you are a Web2 user without a wallet. You can easily log in using Google. In this example, we are at ETH Global Saving. Using the QR code displayed as the venue, we can tip the venue, in this case, the venue Alexandra, and also tip the event organizer, ETH Global. Let's tip 100 BitDrop tokens to the venue Alexandra. We'll need to sign the contract twice, once to give consent for the contract to use the token, and the second time to confirm the transaction. As you can see, the reputation of the venue Alexandra increases by 100. Let's go back to the profile. You can see the tipping history. Now, let's move on the business version. This is a tipping jar for the business, currently holding 199.78 tokens, the BitDrop tokens. The wallet owner can withdraw the BitDrop tokens to their individual address. Let's transfer 99.78 tokens, reducing the venue's reputation scores from 199.78 to 100. Again, we need to sign twice. Returning to the owner's individual wallet, they have the options to fill in, which adds the reputation back to the initial number. The maximum amount the owner can fill in is the total number of tokens they withdraw. It's important to note that the owner cannot buy reputation. It must be tipped. So, we are utilizing Figma for the UI design, and MeetJourney for the cat meme design. And I hope you enjoy this presentation. Have a great day. Thanks.
