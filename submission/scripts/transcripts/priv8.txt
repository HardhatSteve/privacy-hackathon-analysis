Hi, this is Private. It's a decentralized platform where you can create private communities.
Think of it like a decentralized version of Private. Let's log in.
So in the system, all of the data is stored decentralized. So for example,
here you can see the communities and you can add a community here as well.
So if you look into those communities, you can join the community.
Or if you're already joined, you can load the messages.
So what's special about it is that all of the data comes from either blockchain,
the graph or from decentralized storage in an encrypted form.
So when it comes in, it's actually decrypted and displayed to the user.
So some content actually, you can see here, is still encrypted.
So this is using a leads capability that allows you to token gate the encryption.
So in this case, I don't have yet 20 private tokens.
So when people upvote me or upvote my posts, then I will earn more.
But so in this case, I can only see two hours back.
If I want to see more, then I need to have a better score, basically pretty much.
Here I can also add more posts and submit them.
So what is private and how did it come about?
These are the features.
It allows you to create encrypted private communities,
like a decentralized private credit.
You can create communities, you can post and upvote posts to earn karma points.
So if you're in enough karma points, you are able to decrypt more content.
The architecture is as follows.
So storage is in a common.
Inclusion is done by the lead protocol.
And logging and authentication by VFRIOV.
Now all of the smart contracts and there's profile, community,
participation, posts and tokens are running on scroll testnet.
So the future would be to actually extend the extensibility side
to allow either Forecaster or Lens to be up top as the graph layer.
And then have more token gating and logic in the encryption layer.
And also wrap it inside the WhatsApp application to be able to spin up your private
community straight in WhatsApp.
And of course, add more rules, like I said.
Right, so let's check out the contracts and a little bit of code as well.
So here you can see these are the contracts that host the main graph of the application.
So there's not much data stored here.
Most of the posts are actually encrypted and stored elsewhere, right?
But the graph itself, the simple posts are stored here in contracts.
Now I'll also show the index file, JavaScript file.
And I want to show you this part.
So that's the access control conditions for any post.
RPG much like this.
