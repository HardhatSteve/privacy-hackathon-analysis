Hello everyone, my name is Suprabhai and today I am going to present data gen for privacy focused storage plus compute nodes, so first we will process our data over here, so processing means we will use HE encryption to encrypt the data on the client side, so we don't have any chance of data leaks, first we will process the data that is data.csv on the client side, it will be, then we mention that we want to encrypt, now we will see that the data has been processed and we can see over here it has been stored in byte 64 encoded, now let's start the server and store it in the server and perform computation over the data, so now we will go to our web client and present an identifier for the data, so let's say it's personal finance for year 23-24, so we will select a type of encryption method, fully encryption, now let's load the data that we encrypted from the client side, yeah now we have to also mention a description because the compute client has no way of knowing what kind of data we are storing, so I mentioned that it has multiple columns but only computation is allowed on one column, that is amount, yeah, so now I will connect my wallet and go ahead and store the data with the zen node, let's go and store the data, now let's, we are backing up the data so in case the file gets lost, it's been backed up on filecoin using lighthouse SDK, now let's look at the POV of compute client, so we can see this is the data we just uploaded, so we can go ahead and compute using that data, so we will choose a chain in which we prefer to pay and there are 5 types of computation that we can do on FHE data, let's see the sum of all values, so the column I encrypted for all integers so we get the sum of all of them, so let's pay the fee for the computation, this fee is distributed among the compute provider and zen node is the meta provider, so we can see the computation proof, this is continuous computation proof, SDK proof, so we can also cross check that the data, compute results we got is correct, so let's look at the original data in the sum of the columns, so we can see it's 683 over here, so that's it about
