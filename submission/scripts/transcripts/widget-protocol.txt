Hi, we are Widget Protocol. Stay in the loop with ease, widgetize your dApps. Before we get started, I would love to ask you a question. What are the dApps apps you use every day? And how many dApps do you have to do in order to get the information you need every day? Here are the problems that we face every day. So, in order to create an original app for dApps, it is very time consuming and taking it from scratch would be a lot of work. And even if you have an app, keeping the retention rate is very time consuming and it's so much work. Also, even with the app, keeping the information you need, you need to make a lot of taps to get the information you need, which causes a bunch of frustrations for the users. Sorry. So, that's why we are Widget Protocol. Widgets are on the phone that customize modules that displace information and provide quick access for the phone from the home screen without tapping or opening the apps. And Widgets, you can completely see without an app or development and you can also possibly receive information without opening anything, which you can also keep the automatic retention rates for any of the apps that you have. And it is completely crypt-native. Why Widgets? So, Widgets grew 100% in the first week of the iOS 14 release, so we have momentum and Widgets increased engagement. Apps with Widgets have 20% higher retention rate than apps without Widgets. And people with personalized home screen have 26% fewer interactions with their phones per day compared to those with non-personalized screens. Why us? So, we are not Widget makers, we are Widget Protocol, which creates the helps and dapps developers retain their engaged users without creating more apps. And you can also customize Widgets and every audience who uses dapps can also make their own Widgets. And here are the examples that we created so far. QuickNotes, Balance Widgets, Push Protocol, Notification List Widgets, Chat Widgets, and Lens, Favorite User Widgets, Follower Widget, Followers Widgets, Lightbeer Studio, Video NFT Widgets. And this is our team. Everyone is based in Tokyo, everyone is in their 20s, 19. And here are more of the Widgets ideas that will be implemented this month. Link to Pub to display the Pub gallery of your own, Link to Snapshot, Link to Pine Protocol, Works with Daylights, Display list of the lights you are entitled to receive, Works with DappRouter to display the current dapps popularity ranking, Works with FWB, and so on and so forth. And here are the timelists that we'd love to make. April, we'll publish all the Widgets that we just listed, and Widgets IO release. And by May, we'd love to publish 15 Widgets. By June, 200 Widgets. And then we'll make a DAO so that community can make decisions of what kind of Widgets should be released, should not be released. And from July, it will be self-derived based off of the DAO that we made. So this is it. Thank you so much for listening.
