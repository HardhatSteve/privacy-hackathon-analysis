Hi everyone, this is my project developer feedback. This project had to be a roll-up chain on Arbitrum Orbit and avail as a GA layer, but unfortunately I failed with the installation, so I decided to share my feedback on documentation and where I stuck on. Here is my feedback. What I did, I installed Nitro contracts and deployed them, but then I stuck with Orbit setup script, so some of the images couldn't be run. I shared my feedback in my GitHub repo and tried to be as detailed as possible, so you can find the feedback about the documents and all my recommendations, where I stuck and what could be improved. I hope to bring my idea to the next hackathon, that's why I don't give any details on it. I hope my feedback will be useful for document writers of Avail team. Thank you for your attention!
