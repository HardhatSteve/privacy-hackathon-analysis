is Kevin Bluer and I'm going to be walking you through my project, which is something called Flaunt. So what does Flaunt do? It helps you answer that age-old question of, right, I own an NFT, just spent a fortune, awesome, but now what do I do with it? So really what is Flaunt? It enables owners of those NFTs to create new work, new derivative work, new remixes or new derivations as new NFTs based on pieces of art or artifacts or NFTs that they already own. You can see me in the bottom left there and you can see a quick snapshot of Flaunt on the right. Why would you want to do this? A few reasons. Firstly, monetization. You might spend a lot of money on this piece of art and it's just this new world and why not? You can remix it and generate new NFTs that you might sell, customize them a bit further, sign them, whatever. These may be gifted as well to friends, family, co-workers. You might also want more monetization through licensing them. Perhaps you generate some new ones to license on, a bit of a royalty stream going. Lastly, my favorite is just going for why not, you know, for the meme, memefying them and, you know, getting creative. And as we'll see in a moment with the demo, this is a pretty cool tool for which to do kind of all of the above. Cool. So with that, let's jump into the demo. So I've got it open right here. Let's go to flaunt.wtf. This is what you see. And first thing you do is go ahead and load up an existing asset. I've got some samples here. You can also load based directly off of a contract address. So this is a foundation's contract address. And you put in the ID. You can kind of randomize it and pull in stuff and play around with it, which is kind of neat. I'm just going to go with a sample just because of the interest of time. So I'm going to pull in a kind of funky cartoon-style doge. But now we're going to remix. So let's bring in Swallow Doge. Let's bring in some laser eyes. Oops. Over there. Let's bring in a troll. Because why not? Who doesn't love a troll? Let's add in some text. Scaling for the win. Because this has been an awesome hackathon. And then lastly, going to do a quick little signature in the bottom right to just customize this. Because this was a new piece I've just created based on an existing piece I own already. Cool. All right. So, you know, how do we do this? This is where kind of the magic happens in terms of both creating the NFT and, you know, going through that kind of whole beautiful L2 workflow. So, Caller Doge. For the win. And let's go ahead and save it to IPFS. Pretty neat. It does it for you. So it just pumps this image over just to show it's not smoke and mirrors. You can see through the gateway there. Same for the metadata. And put in through the gateway. You can go ahead and preserve it through Filecoin. I've got Filecoin flavor ganache running locally. That was a simulation of a deal creation there. You can preserve it with pinata in a longer term storage. Then we go ahead and mint. So, firstly, of course, you can mint just directly to the L1. If you've got plenty of ether and you're feeling rich and don't mind spending the gas, go ahead. Of course, that's not going to be the case for everyone. So, you can mint a couple of choices of L2s right now. So, you can mint it to scale, switch your metamask to scale, mint directly. In this case, I'm going to mint it to Arbitrum. So, I'm signed in via Taurus, as you can see up here. Let's go ahead and do that. Brings up a separate dialog box. You can see my account address. I've got some ether on both sides here. Let's go ahead and mint. It kicks it off. It does take a moment. So, I'm just going to go ahead and close that. Jump into the gallery. This is where you see all the ones on your L2 and all the ones on the L1. In the interests of time, I'm just going to pull up a random one that's already on Arbitrum. This is a kind of troll remix. And then, of course, I can go ahead and withdraw that back to the L1, initiate the withdraw. But that's a pretty cool one. And that's kind of it. Let's just look at one final one. Cool. So, that's Flaunt. Flaunt your NFTs, generate value, downstream value with them. Have fun. Use an L2. Why not?
