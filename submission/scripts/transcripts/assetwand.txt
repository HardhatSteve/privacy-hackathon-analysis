Hi, this is AssetOne, an AI tool that can purchase real-world assets. Let me show you a demo. First let me see a hotel that is near a market. So AI is querying the database and it's giving us the NFTs that are linked to the real-world assets. So as you can see here, there are two hotels. So let's say I want to purchase the ID 4. So I just type purchase 4. As you can see here, the AI is actually making a trade and purchasing the property for us. So here it is, the NFT is purchased successfully. Now let me show you how it works. So here, this is the infrastructure of AssetOne. So here we have off-chain data. So we are running a chain link operator that extracts off-chain data and loads it into the blockchain. So when it loads it into the blockchain, it actually mints new real-world assets. And now we have event listeners that listen to these real-world assets. These assets are linked to a metadata which is updated by chain link, the chain link operator. So now the metadata is now saved in a vector database. It could be saved in any data engine. Now the AI chatbot, it will service the user requirements. So it will go and search for the right asset and then make the trade in the blockchain. Now future goals. Let's say you want to start a farm. Now you can ask the AI, show me farmland in north of Bangkok and then you can actually purchase that. Then you can look for other assets like drone swarms or fertilizers or anything which you can use to make the farm. Now the future is AI is going to help us or it's going to make a lot of decisions easier for us. The idea of the future is everyone is a solo entrepreneur. So AI can create entire businesses, it can purchase properties or it can run entirely by itself with minimal human interaction. So the idea is to load option data into blockchain so that AI can make decisions easily. So thank you.
