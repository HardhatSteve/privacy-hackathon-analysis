All right, welcome to Splitit. Splitit is an app to track and settle expenses in a group of friends, just like Splitwise or Tricount. Except here we use the power of the blockchain and smart accounts so we can do the settling up in one go. So what I will do is I will log in with my phone number. I will receive an SMS and fill in the code to 6XZQP. And right now there is a key pair being created in the phone, doesn't leave the phone, that is connected to the phone number through some clever cryptography and through accounts abstraction. This app has a crypto wallet inside of it basically. And so back to the splitting feature. We need first to join a group, so I'll do that now. There we go. This has fetched a group between Kevin and me from the blockchain. We've added some expenses already and we can go in the summary, how much money each will receive back. Now if I click the split function, so we have funded the group already, which is what you do when you, so here we track the expenses and then after for example the trip or after like a night out it's like okay now it's time to settle up. We send the token of choice to the group and then the split button becomes available. We will click it and this is sending on the blockchain the right amounts of money to the people that should receive the money.
