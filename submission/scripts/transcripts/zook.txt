Here this is Dhruv from Zouk. Zouk is a payment channel solution enabling ZK-powered yield-centering transactions. Now, sender can create a payment channel between them and the receiver and then do a number of transactions without paying any GSVs and just by clearing signatures and promises in form of receipts to the receiver and the receiver can later withdraw the amount just using the signatures. In between, a yield is generated using MakerDAO to actually earn even while transacting. Let me show you more on the same. So here is the architecture of our protocol and I will come back to it later when we actually work on it. But here's a user flow. So first of all, when user comes to the application, they can connect using WalletConnect. There are a number of applications options available. In my case, here you can see there's a good interface of WalletConnect to connect your wallet directly and then switch chains and all. Then they can choose if they want to be sender or receiver. Similarly, so here you can choose if I want to sender or receiver. After choosing, becoming a sender, I can start creating a channel. When I want to create a channel, I can enter the receiver's address. So in my case, I just want to create a receiver as another account, and that's what I will be doing here. So I enter the receiver address and then a minimum channel duration, which will be responsible for closing the channel later when the duration is passed. So sender can actually come and close the channel and take the funds out. Before the expiration period, the receiver has to claim the funds. What we do in the backend is that we create a safe contract wallet in the backend itself for this new channel, and the funds are added to the safe contract. From there on, the user just need to sign a single transaction, just sign a message for it, and then the message is sent from the sender to receiver via XMTP, which is acting as our network protocol, which is responsible for handling all the communications between sender and receiver. Later on, an attestation is made to create a proof of transaction here itself, and then it is added in our ZOOP module. We have built a safe module for enabling payment channels on top of SAFE itself, so that allows us to make SAFE much more usable and at the same time keep your funds secure and safe. So we are using EAS for attestations on the attestations to show proof of transaction. It will be acting as an explorer, and we attest private off-chain attestations to preserve the user's data and maintain the privacy at the same time. SAFE is used to store all the funds at the same time, so all the funds, and while the yield is being generated and the attestations are happening. EZ-DBing is a messaging protocol we are using to connect the sender and receiver. WalletConnect is using for three wallet connections. Megadow SPA protocol helped us to generate yield for the user while keeping the funds safe, and SysMO allows us to verify the recipient when they want to withdraw some amount from the channel. They can just use a signature, and along with that, they have to provide a ZK proof, which is provided by SysMO to allow them to withdraw from the channel. Thank you for your time. Have a good day.
