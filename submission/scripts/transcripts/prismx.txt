and you basically feel like using tinder but you're actually betting on prediction markets with real money on chain. The core USP of our product is two sides one is the one being consumer focused where we just want to make it so simple for the user just that they log in with their email or they log in with their any wallet and they just swipe right or left on markets and then just bet money on it. It's built on top of Arbitrum Orbit as an L3 for faster finalities faster confirmation so it doesn't feel like they have to wait for a bit until you know their transactions are confirmed and that's one USP. Second USP is I recently got to know that you know polymarkets bet of presidential elections was such a big market of a billion dollars which was resolved by UMA protocol. The way UMA protocol works is by just like the token holders of UMA basically vote on the association itself and this is a very bad economic security standpoint because the total market cap FTB of UMA token itself is around 300 million dollars so you're basically telling me the economic security for resolving a billion dollar market cap token billion dollar prediction market is just 300 million dollars so for anyone could just go inside buy 300 million dollars worth of UMA tokens and then just manipulate the market and then turn the odds to their favors and then basically hijack the outcome of the prediction market. So what we have done here is we have used AI agents to come up with resolutions for the particular bet. There are like n number of AI agents that has access to internet that goes out and then independently comes to an outcome then basically this consensus builder AI agent that takes the input from five of them and then builds the consensus output and then that output is the resolving you know outcome of a prediction market then the market is settled based on that decision so now we are relying on five autonomous agents independently not really on human or whatever biasness is provided. I'm going to just quickly show the demo I'm going to just show my app deployed on prism I'm just going to connect my metamask so we are there and let me just okay so you can see these are this is the home page right now there are a couple of bets and this being one of them so on a mobile phone this is basically pwa on the mobile phone and you can just swipe right to bet and you just swipe right and let's say will the prism team win bounties in Bangkok. So I'm going to just say five or three or whatever it's just going to swipe right and now if you go to the profile page you should be seeing all those things that you just bet as well as you just will be depositing funds before you get started with placing bets so everything is so fast that you would not even notice how fast it's happening this is an arbitrary orbit rollout you can see things get updated as soon as so that's that's pretty much it for the demo and I would like to you know also create a bet but due to time constraints I'm not going to do that now but it's pretty easy like you just create a market out of it and it's also supported on morph chain as well morph holds sky currently two chains that's the app part of it creating a market and then betting on it consumer side of it I'm going to quickly show the AI agents resolving my particular bucket so the agents are currently deployed on
