All right, so welcome to the Fit with Friends presentation. So what we've built is a commitment app. And so the idea behind it is that everyone wants to commit to something, but we all don't do that well at that. So what this does is we try to hold you more accountable to your commitments. And we do that by connecting to third-party connections, which allows us to get data about what you're doing in the world. And so the examples we have here is that you can connect to Strava. And with that, we can get your exercise data. And if you've signed up to a commitment of exercise, we can ensure you did it. And the other one here we have is Stack Exchange. So let's just say you wanted to be a good developer and give back to the community and answer two questions a week, we can hold you accountable to that as well. So here we go. We'll go for the process. So with the login, we're using WorldID. And the reason we're doing that is because Strava doesn't use WorldID. And because they don't use WorldID, they can basically... anyone can create as many accounts as they want on Strava. And so if they create as many accounts as they want, and we're not using WorldID, then they can link as many accounts as they want, and therefore they could make a lot of money from all the commitments they've said they're doing, but they're not really doing. So here's the main page, and once we're logged in, you can see these are the commitments available. But to actually commit to them, you need to link to the required provider, which in this case will be Strava. So we'll go in here. We'll authorize Strava. Now we've authorized it. Basically, now we can commit. So when we hit commit, we're going to have to connect our MetaMask wallet. So once we've connected it, this basically allows us to see the stuff from Chain. So this is all from Chain. This is from what's already been staked, and we've already staked 100. And what we really want to bet on ourselves to do is 90 minutes of exercise a week. So we're going to up that stake. We're going to up this stake. So we've upped the stake now, and now that's been confirmed, now you can see we've staked $150. So the idea behind this is at the end of every week, we use Chainlink functions, and we call into our API, and we talk to the connected providers, which will be Strava, and we see who did their 90 minutes of exercise and at least three activities. And then basically we distribute those funds between the people. So the people who did do the activities and did succeed, well, they'll keep their FIT dollars. And the people who didn't do the activities, that'll be distributed to the people who did do the activities. So there's a bit of incentive to keep them going. Anyway, so that's basically it.
