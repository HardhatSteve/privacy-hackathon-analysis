Hey there, so what I want to do is go through a quick demo to show you what I've done here. Essentially, what I want to do is bring more data on-chain, in particular, WebPixels. So WebPixels are data on e-commerce stores. So for example, if I were to follow this QR code to the destination URL, this data is tracked on the e-commerce store. So for example, the product viewed here has the product view event as also the actual product itself in terms of where it comes from, the referral. So we can go here to expand the event refer, but there's a lot of information. So for example, if we set up the listener to add to cart, that 1025 will also pop up as a product added to cart, and when we check out, the same thing will happen. So right now, I'm just going to go back to here. Because we viewed the product, we're going to refresh this cumulative count of product viewed and bring that on-chain. So what happens when we bring on-chain is that we can use those functions for smart contracts, and particularly in this example, we use it for NFTs and changing the SVG of the NFT. So just to refresh, the cart cost function is what you just saw here that has the stats, and then it essentially takes a source from a API, which consolidates this amount of information, and it's basically on the backend that feeds the on-chain chain-link function. And then you have a subgraph here, which benchmarks the NFTs that are minted, but that NFT event involving checkout SVG essentially compares the checkout value, so the cumulative value of checkouts, with the ETH price. So even checkouts are in a previous event that I did here, because checkouts do take some time to fill in the information. So product add to cart, product viewed, checkout completed. So this is an event checkout completed, where I added this information as something I was interested in, but this data object also has a bunch of data, like your email, the location as well, which I think with collaboration with creators, we can really incentivize creators to push certain metrics, or look at ways to drive their community. So that NFT was an example, where we have a live benchmark, ETHUSD, and we're comparing it to the checkout sales. When checkout sales exceed ETHUSD, then the SVG will turn from an unhappy face to a happy face. So that's what this evolving checkout SVG is, is where if we were to look at the contract here, that is what we do. So we have a getChing data feed, as well as a cumulative checkout value function that looks at the other smart contract, and then we also used a subgraph. So this is the graphs that we index it, instead of looping through the token IDs. And then we also have a token, where we use chain link to find the exact price of ETH, and we're able to pay in ETH, but mint tokens, ERC tokens by quoting in US dollars. Since we have four minutes, I think that's it. Thank you.
