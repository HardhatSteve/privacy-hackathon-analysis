Chris Salvador and I created a zero-knowledge vendor credentialing smart contract. I've worked in the healthcare industry as a service engineer and I see an opportunity for zero-knowledge practical use related to vendor credentialing. It's a redundant process where annually vendors submit copies of personal and medical records to various vendor credentialing companies in order to gain access to hospitals to perform service work. It's a pain point for all vendors and we pretty much deal with this every single time. The benefits of zero-knowledge will be increased privacy and security, improved time and costs, and ensure compliance. All these benefits are achieved by eliminating the redundancy of creating multiple instances of medical records. It's a perfect opportunity to introduce zero-knowledge and the blockchain into healthcare. The smart contract was created with MENA's protocol tools utilizing ZK-SNARKs and the ease of TypeScript. Its smart contract design basically starts off with creating a Merkle tree off-chain and the leaves of the tree will represent the fields of data of a medical record. The root is generated from this tree and then stored on MENA, which will then allow a process for the verifier to calculate a root with the witness of the leaves' interest and then this proof is then compared to the root on-chain and it will receive verification. The Merkle tree leaves can also be updated off-chain and the root of the on-chain can be updated then. Now it's time for the demo. So it'll start off by creating the Merkle tree information offline. There's several details that's shown that will be used for the address, the social security number, and some data points. After the initial commitment is created, as you can see, then the smart contract is deployed and then the verification process starts to begin. It'll start by verifying the address. As you can see there, it's already been verified. The social security number check has also been verified. There's also several commitment checks that I had in the smart contract run to show later on the update record process. Also you can see that next to vendor data one and vendor data two have been processed and the credentials are showing as verified. I've also put in a test to check when the address was inputted with incorrect data and as expected, the credential verification did fail. For the updating a record, I had an example where I appended new information into one of the leaves of the Merkle tree and in this case, you can see that after the record has been updated, the commitment check shows that it's different than the previous commitment check and this is what expected. At the very end, you can see that there's a request to verify the data that was updated to make sure that it's now passing. Thank you for your time.
