Hi there, my name is Mohak and together with my team we build CK, the first CK PayPal on-off-ramp built by cryptonatives for cryptonatives. The real problem with centralized on-ramps stems from inconsistent regulations and frustrating delays. Especially in Australia, funds can take up to 24 hours to be received in centralized exchanges or wallets if you're using traditional on-ramp methods. Additionally, there is centralization privacy concerns and lack of modular innovation, which does not allow these centralized on-ramps to seamlessly integrate into completely decentralized and cryptonative applications, blockchains, and protocols. The second problem we wanted to tackle was the underserved market on Telegram. So how big this market really is, right? There's more than 9 billion trading volume on trading bots just to put a number to this, to create like this scale of the problem, right? And 80% of the trading bot volume is through Telegram bots. So this is a huge opportunity and a highly underserved area. And that's why we made CK, which is basically a Telegram mini-app integration, which uses account abstraction-powered user experience to create a really, really simple user experience for anyone trying to on-ramp. And that's really incentivizing new people to come in on board their funds to crypto. It's fully decentralized. There's no single point of failure. It's fast. We have optimized the circuits to the point where we have 41.2 second proof time, which allows us to fulfill any order in less than a minute. And we also are able to do this because of our custom relay infrastructure. I'll get more into that later, but we also enforce no chargebacks. So there's no malicious activities encouraged or otherwise any bad actors in the system. And yeah, so it's pretty quick. The way it works, I would love to show you the demo right now. So here we are in Telegram and we start the mini-app. I will create a new account using my email. So it will create a self-custodial wallet for me. And I enter my email and the amount I want to on-ramp. And I've got my PayPal email, my receiver wallet address, and the amount. The next thing is my order gets submitted. And now finding liquidity is to do with the relay and fraud, right? So that's really what's doing the heavy lifting here. And once that's done, I will be prompted to make the PayPal payment. And this payment is really what's used to mathematically validate the authenticity of the payment made and verify the amount and the recipient and senders and the DKIM header, which contains this really important signature, which allows us to say, okay, this email is really valid or no, it's not valid. And if it's valid, only then the funds are released to the user. So once I make the PayPal payment, that's pretty much it, right? So now basically my payment has been received and I'm just waiting to get my order fulfilled and that's it. So I have 10 USDC in less than a minute.
