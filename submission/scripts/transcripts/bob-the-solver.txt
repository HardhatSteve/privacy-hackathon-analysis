Welcome to Bobbi solver, which is an infrastructure for intent based transactions.
So, what are intents? Intents are basically desired outcomes that users want. And by transactions
which is the current paradigm through which we interact with blockchain are the actions that
must be performed. So, an example would be for intent that a user wants to buy xyznft on
polygon. But then to execute this, if the user just has assets on Ethereum, they first have to swap
and then do again as then perform another swap and then buy the NFT and define the tribe that
they want to. But initially they just had this intent that they want to buy this NFT or they
would want to buy the NFT when it's raining or with a cross on whatever.
But why do we really need intents? Users currently need to define transactions but like
defining transactions is complicated. Users need to know about all protocols and how to interact
with them. They need to know about gas management, non-smanagement and they also need to know about
all kinds of transactions, hoping to resume etc etc. Users, even though if even they figured out
they do it in an unoptimized way and they don't get the best traits, they get front-run,
and it's also time-taking and frustrating. A solution here is that you outsource the transaction
creation to a trusted third party and then enable transaction execution through an account
abstraction wallet. In reducing Bob the intents or Bob is an sophisticated solver that basically
picks up intents and generates transactions from intents without taking the full control from the
user and then it gets executed through an account abstraction wallet. This paradigm basically
enables us to get a better UX and better efficiency.
So this is the demo of an implementation of Bob running at the back end of a chat-based UI.
Let's give Bob and Prompt where we ask him to give the best maximum USD tokens against point
1, and Bob does it figures out that it will require a swap of point 1 and then once the user is
fine with this transaction it then goes ahead and executes it. It also asks for a second
factor authentication through Touch ID which is powered by bananas SDKs app and extraction
wallet and as we can see after a while that the transaction happened. Now let's
pick a more sophisticated example where which would require bridging and stating multiple
transactions at the same. So here we ask Bob to stake point 002 for the best yield and Bob does
its magic and it figures out that this will require to get the best yield, this will require a
bridging and then staking on an obvious looking contract and once the user authenticates that he's
fine with this to factor authentication we go ahead and see that the transaction is executed and
then we can also confirm that there was a bridge transaction as well between polygon and avalanche.
Now given Rob is a sophisticated solver it can also identify certain things which might be
harmful for the user. For example here the user wants to bid 10 ETH but then Bob for an
NFT but then Bob realizes that the current price is just 5.6 ETH so it just wants the user that
this might not be the most optimal thing to do.
