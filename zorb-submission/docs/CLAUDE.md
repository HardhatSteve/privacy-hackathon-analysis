# Submission Directory

Hackathon submission materials for ZORB — Solana Privacy Hackathon 2026.

## Working Principle

**Spec-first development**: The submission deliverables below are the ground truth. All related assets (video animations, screen recordings, graphics) should be derived from these specs. When in doubt, refer back to the deliverables — work from the spec outwards.

## Submission Deliverables (Ground Truth)

These files define what the final submission looks like. Treat as authoritative:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `FINAL_SUBMISSION.md` | Form answers ready to paste into Typeform |
| `VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` | 3-minute demo video script with narration and timing |
| `README.md` | Submission overview and quick links |

## Strategy & Research

Files that inform our submission angle and competitive positioning:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `JUDGING_CRITERIA.md` | Hackathon judging rubric and how ZORB scores against it |
| `ZORB_HACKATHON_SUBMISSION_PLAN.md` | Full submission strategy and timeline |
| `ZORB_SUBMISSION_TRACKER.md` | Task checklist for submission completion |
| `ZORB_10HR_SUBMISSION_TRACKER.md` | Compressed 10-hour sprint plan |

## Sponsor Bounty Research

Analysis for potential sponsor prize eligibility:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SPONSOR_BOUNTY_ANALYSIS.md` | Analysis of sponsor bounties and ZORB eligibility |
| `SPONSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Technical guide for integrating sponsor technologies |
| `SPONSOR_INTEGRATIONS.md` | Summary of which sponsors ZORB integrates |
| `LIGHT_PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION.md` | Detailed Light Protocol integration analysis |

## Video Production

**Ground truth**: `VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` defines the video structure, timing, narration, and visuals.

Assets derived from the script:
1. **Motion Canvas animations** (`../video-animations/`) — Visual scenes for Hook, Problem, Solution, CTA
2. **Screen recordings** — Live demo at zorb.cash/stress-test, code walkthrough, Solana Explorer
3. **Final edit** — All assets stitched together per script timing using FFmpeg

When creating or modifying video assets, always check `VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` first to ensure alignment with the spec.
